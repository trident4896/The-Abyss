In this case, the protagonist has stumbled upon an experience that is close to “stepping into hell”. 

The backstory of this game is there a guy named Fahri was an accountant that worked in Kuala Lumpur city for few years’ long back in 1960s.
Unfortunately, due to the economy crisis that brings his job into an end. 
He had no choice left but to take charge of rubber tree land that inherited from his grandmother. 

By the time, he reached his grandmother’s traditional Malay Kampong house, it is already midnight. 
He unloaded the suitcases and belongings into the house. 
Hence, there was no electricity inside the house, so he seeks for the engine room to light up the whole house. 
Unfortunately, the engine was too old and rusty that makes it faulty and unable to start up. 
So Fahri has left only to light up candles to carry on shifting the items. Suddenly he stepped on a totem and accidentally broke it. 
Thus, a strange voice was heard and comes from the living room. 
Fahri was scared and decided to run to the front door, but unfortunately the door was sealed by strange symbols.
He had no choice left but to search the rest of the house for exit. 

Fahri still didn’t know that the totem he broke has released a ghost. 
The strange voice was coming from that ghost. He seeks through the whole house and found a book with “Relic Seals” on it. 
Thus, he read the book and found out that his grandmother was a bomoh all along. 
Later soon, he found out he has accidentally released a ghost from the broke totem. 
Hence, he understands that the seals were a protective shield to prevent any runaway ghosts from escaping the house. 
It was a safety mechanism invented by his.
