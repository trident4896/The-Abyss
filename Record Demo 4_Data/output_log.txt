No Cardboard instance found.  Ensure one exists in the scene, or callCardboard.Create() at startup to generate one.
If one does exist but hasn't called Awake() yet, then this error is due to order-of-initialization.
In that case, consider moving your first reference to Cardboard.SDK to a later point in time.
If exiting the scene, this indicates that the Cardboard object has already been destroyed.
